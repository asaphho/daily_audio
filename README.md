<h1>About</h1>

This project contains a simple python script for running on a raspberry pi. It will play an audio file corresponding to the date when a button is pushed.

<h1>Setting up the pi</h1>

The pi needs to be configured with the correct location (e.g. Singapore) and connected to the Internet in order for the clock to work (it needs the date when the script is running).
Once that is done, open the terminal on the pi and do the following:

<ol>
<li>Make sure you are in the home directory, or navigate to it with 
```sh
cd /home/pi
```
</li>
</ol>
